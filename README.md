# MYCURE-assessment-exam

My approach to this exam is to explain what I have studied over the past two weeks. It has been difficult to produce results as quickly as I desired. I leaned more into AI tools for polishing and error debugging for the more complex problems throughout the week which had its own ups and downs.

I was able to provide quick results but lack in basic knowledge for the foundations due to experience. Unfortunately, I have not been able to study further into Vue for the assessment and this exam which then was the major part of this exam.

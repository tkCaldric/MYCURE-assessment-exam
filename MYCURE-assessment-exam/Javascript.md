1. Async function waits for the promise to resolve and does not stop other functions and code from continuing and executing while Await requires the Promise as a key to continue and will pause the function until it does.
2. Destructuring in javascript is like the linking of values into their variable which usually is the other way around. For objects example is a simple birthday, if my birthday is 02/07, then in code it can trans late to {02,07} which would then equal my birthday. For arrays is simpler, its the calling of certain index or value of the array as to call only a specific point of the array whether to add or state the value of it along with other values.

3. map() transforms the element and calls the value after the condition it is given.
ex.  ages.map(age => age*3); #returns ages in the array multiplied by 3
filter() returns value that passes certain gates
ex.  ages.filter(age>10); #return ages in the array greater than 10
reduce() is just the sum of the values specified and useful for ordering and sequencing
ex.  ages.reduce(age); #should return sum of age values in ages array

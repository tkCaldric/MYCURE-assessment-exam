1. Semantic Elements are elements that give description exactly to the page or application. Examples of these are tables, images or addresses. All of which are descriptive and straight to the relation of the subject/topic.

2. Flexbox is useful for having aligned and arranged elements that need to be properly placed to emphasize the element. Grid is useful when you have multiple elements that dont need aligning and has more flexibility on the placing of elements. You should choose Grid if you are focusing on keeping the layout of the page and being able to fit all or as much as you can in a container  etc. Flexbox is for when you need to prioritize the content and having them aligned and uniform to one another.

3. CSS custom properties or variables are just that, variables. Variables that you call for when you need its certain value with its naming designed for better uniformity based on what you require at the moment.
